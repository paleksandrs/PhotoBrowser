Single screen iOS application build using TDD approach in Swift. The purpose of this example application is do demonstrate clean code principles (e.g. single responsibility, open-closed, dependency inversion etc.), different design patterns (e.g. factory, coordinator, builder, protocol etc.), mocking and dependency injection approach in Swift using test driven development. The application loads data from Flickr API and displays it inside a table view. 

Note, this is just a simple example application, there was not optimisation done, only basic error handling was implemented.
